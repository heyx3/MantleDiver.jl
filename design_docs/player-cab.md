# The mining pod

The player can look out of the front of the pod to see the world through a totally-transparent glass.
On the inside walls of the pod are various displays (depending on how the pod is upgraded).

Mined minerals are liquified and stored in a pressurized container in the pod, alongside the player in the return-to-surface unit.
The mineral levels are visible on one of the inside wall displays.

The pod itself will have various upgrades, which only last for one outing.
The pod's properties and upgrades are as follows:

## Storage Space

* Each type of material you can mine has its own storage slot, which compresses the material into a small pocket in the pod
* Plain rock has storage space too; once it's full you can't mine any more
* You can also upgrade the space to allow the whole thing to fit any type of material
  * This is a special upgrade requiring multiple types of materials.
* You can upgrade rock storage to vaporize the rock, removing the need to store it
  * This is a special upgrade requiring multiple types of materials.
* Upgraded with the mineral *kertil*, except as mentioned above

## Hull Integrity

* Many pod maneuvers add stress to the hull, such as fall-damage.
* Too much stress, and it starts collapsing. When this happens, the player is immediately ejected with their mined material, back to home. The mission is over.
* Can be upgraded for overall health and/or resistance to heat
* Upgraded with the material *gelstance*

## Drill

* The drill's speed depends on the material it's moving through.
* Drill speed is upgraded per-material.
  * This adds more value to the planning phase; the player has to decide which materials to prioritize based on both what they want, and what the level contains.
* Upgraded with the material "mytil"

## Specials

* **Shaped charges**: lay down some charges along consecutive spaces in the rock voxel grid, then detonate them all at once, vaporizing the rock and leaving only mineral
* **Neutrino laser**: identify mineral sources through the rock, displaying as colored rocks behind other rocks.
* **Jump jet**: launch straight upwards and lock your position as if you're on the ground
* **Breadcrumbs**: drop waypoints on the grid space you're currently occupying to help you mark areas and orient yourself
* Upgraded with the mineral "silbon"

* **Deep Start**: spend a *lot* of any one mineral type to get yourself launched deeper into the map (effectively, pan the level generator downwards by N units) to get right to the richer areas.

## Sensors

* Main view of the world starts black-and-white
  * You can upgrade to greyscale for better detection of minerals
  * You can upgrade it to color for *really* good detection of minerals
* You can quickly rotate the view of your vehicle in 90-degree increments.
* You can add another view which senses and displays all rock you've encountered in the level.
* You can upgrade the length, breadth, and intensity of your flashlight (without which you only have environmental lighting to see with)
* Hypersonic transducer, providing a noisy horizontal live-scanning of minerals
* Upgraded with the mineral "gahp"

## Maneuverability

* The basic pod can move forward/back, strafe, and drill in all 6 orthogonal directions.
  * Note that drilling upward normally causes you to immediately fall back down.
* Some maneuvers can be "bracing", meaning the drill cab can hold itself in place as long as there's an adjacent rock to latch onto.
* Upgrades you can make to maneuverability are:
  * Cross over single empty spaces, both straight ahead and around a corner
  * Climb ledges (of increasing heights with higher upgrades)
  * Reduce fall damage
  * Increase maneuver speed scale (not drilling speed; that's handled elsewhere)
  * Always brace after drilling (a high-level, expensive upgrade that significantly changes late-game play)
* Upgraded with the mineral "ourin"
